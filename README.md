You can change the dishes to whatever you want, the list is mainly placeholder since I'm not sure how many dishes you were wanting.
But I put quite a few in there.

How to request data:
Create a function that looks like send_temperature (sender.py)
Make sure to run the microservice first (reciever.py)
Then run your main program, collect a temp from the user, and call the send_temperature function.

How to recieve data: 
After calling the function, the programs will communicate with each other. The reciever will get the temp and send back a dish.
Right now in sender.py I'm storing it in a global variable, but you can store it wherever you want.
It also prints the dish when it is sent back.
